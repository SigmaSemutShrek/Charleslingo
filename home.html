        Kids face challenges when learning Mathematics. Math requires practice to master. Math can also help problem solving skills in real life. Students will be nervous when teacher is teaching and they know nothing. It seems difficult to understand basic concepts of Maths like timetable or operations, so we create CHARLESLINGO. It gives Maths questions and the players have to solve it. This way, it can increase their speed of doing Maths and pass their exams with flying colours!
